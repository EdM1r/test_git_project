Hello, this is second test project from Hexlet cource on git.

If you are wondering, why one has 2 test git projects, I'll explain. I 
started git cource on hexlet back in Jan and continued to the jorney of 
Python developer. However, due to well-known-events, I had to switch to 
learning German. Now I'm almost finished my German cource and can focus 
on programming. That's why I decided to retake this git cource, to 
refresh the memory.
